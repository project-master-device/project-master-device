/**
 * \defgroup uipbuf uIP data buffering helper library.
 *
 * The event driven API that uIP uses can be tricky to use when
 * dealing with incoming TCP data. The data can be split over any
 * number of incoming segments and uIP does not provide any stream
 * abstraction by itself. To remedy this, the uIP data buffering
 * helper library provides a set of functions that make buffering data
 * easier.
 *
 * The data buffering library provides a structure that holds a
 * pointer to a buffer and the state of the buffer, as well as a set
 * of functions for manipulating the buffer state. The functions are
 * intended to facilitate buffering of both data that is of a known
 * size and data that is terminated by a specified byte.

 * Buffer data until a specific character is found or the buffer is full.

 * the end-marker byte, if the marker was found. If the marker was not
 * found and all of the data was buffered, the value of
 * UIPBUF_NOT_FOUND is returned. If the marker was not found, but the
 * data made the buffer fill up, the value of UIPBUF_FULL is returned.
