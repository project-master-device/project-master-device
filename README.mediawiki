= Description =
The goal of this project is to create hardware and software platform that allows you integrate many devices into single network and control it from simple python interface.

[[File:http://github.com/project-master-device/project-master-device/raw/master/doc/img/pic_system.png]]

System’s '''hardware''' consists of one master (pc or embedded board), many slaves (controllers) and wired network to connect them (Controller Area Network).

'''Master''' runs under GNU/Linux. System’s software on master provides API for user’s applications that allows them to control slaves and their devices. Actually, it is a set of libraries, which contains basic network library and device drivers libraries (for each device). Each library has python binding.

'''Slave''' runs under Contiki OS. System’s software on slave consist of two parts:

#Basic firmware part with network capabilities.
#Drivers for devices, which builds into firmware.

To add new device to the network, you need to provide device driver for slave and device driver for master. Driver provides device API for application, which controls the network.

It can be applied for both industrial and home automation.



== Where it really stopped ==

=== Hardware ===
(the one that worked last time)

master: ooooold (200Mhz/32Mb RAM) ARM board

slave: Atmel at90can128.


=== Perfomance notes ===
(on hardware listed higher)

Sending commands from pure C interface:

  delay was acceptable ( undetectable with bare eye ( <100ms ) )

Sending same commands from python:

  ~500ms (need better HW for master)

=== Simultaneous work of more than one app ===

not supported

=== Applications created ===

Access Control System: not adopted for system.

Test application: nonexistent.
