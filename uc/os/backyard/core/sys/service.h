/**
 * \defgroup service The Contiki service mechanism
 *
 * The Contiki service mechanism enables cross-process functions. A
 * service that is registered by one process can be accessed by other
 * processes in the system. Services can be transparently replaced at
 * run-time.
 *
 * A service has an interface that callers use to access the service's
 * functions. This interface typically is defined in a header file
 * that is included by all users of the service. A service interface
 * is defined with the SERVICE_INTERFACE() macro.
 *
 * A service implementation is declared with the SERVICE() macro. The
 * SERVICE() statement specifies the actual functions that are used to
 * implement the service.
 *
 * Every service has a controlling process. The controlling process
 * registers the service with the system when it starts, and is also
 * notified if the service is removed or replaced. A process may
 * register any number of services.
 *
 * Service registration is done with a SERVICE_REGISTER()
 * statement. If a service with the same name is already registered,
 * this is removed before the new service is registered.
 *
 * The SERVICE_CALL() macro is used to call a service. If the service
 * to be called is not registered, the SERVICE_CALL() statement does
 * nothing. The SERVICE_FIND() function can be used to check if a
 * particular service exists before calling SERVICE_CALL().
